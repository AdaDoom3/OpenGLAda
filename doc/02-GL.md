# The package `GL`

This is the root package of the core OpenGL wrapper.

The index types for vector and matrix types are defined here because they would cause
problems with cyclic dependencies when they were defined in `GL.Types`.

`Flush` and `Finish` act like their conterparts in the OpenGL API.
