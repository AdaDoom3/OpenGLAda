# The package `GL.Fixed`

This package includes all functionality related to the fixed function pipeline,
which has been deprecated with OpenGL 3.0.

With the functions of this package, you can enable vertex buffer object functionality
and draw VBOs. Note that the functionality of passing vertex arrays directly to
OpenGL is not included here as it offers a very tiny performance gain compared to the
immediate API.
