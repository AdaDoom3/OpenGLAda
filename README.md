# OpenGLAda - Yet Another OpenGL binding for Ada

**OpenGLAda** is a fat OpenGL binding for the Ada programming language.
Unlike other bindings (see the project's homepage for a list - coming soon),
OpenGLAda enriches the original API with concepts and features provided by
Ada, like object orientation, type safety and generics.

In addition to the core OpenGL API, wrappers for GLU and GLFW are also
included. GLU is the standardized OpenGL Utility Library, while GLFW is
a third-party library that provides functions to create a window or a
fullscreen display with an OpenGL context on it. GLFW also inlcudes functions
for basic input handling.

OpenGLAda supports MacOSX, Windows and Linux with X11. It may also work
on other X11-based operating systems.

For additional information and documentation, see the project's homepage
(coming soon).
