# OpenGLAda - Yet Another OpenGL binding for Ada

**OpenGLAda** is a fat OpenGL binding for the Ada programming language.
Unlike other bindings (see the
[project's homepage](http://flyx86.github.com/OpenGLAda/) for a list),
OpenGLAda enriches the original API with concepts and features provided by
Ada, like object orientation, type safety and generics.

In addition to the core OpenGL API, a wrapper for GLFW is also
included. GLFW is a third-party library that provides functions to create a window
or a fullscreen display with an OpenGL context on it. GLFW also includes functions
for basic input handling.

OpenGLAda supports MacOSX, Windows and Linux with X11. It may also work
on other X11-based operating systems.
