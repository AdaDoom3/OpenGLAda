## About

- - -

*OpenGLAda is currently being developed. Lots of features are not yet implemented, and most of the code is untested. Be warned.*

- - -

**OpenGLAda** is a thick Ada binding for [OpenGL](http://www.opengl.org/) and
[GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/). It enables you to create complex graphical
applications in Ada, using the OpenGL industry standard.

OpenGLAda is not the first attempt to create an OpenGL binding for Ada. Other bindings
are:

 * [AdaOpenGL](http://adaopengl.sourceforge.net/): Afaik the first binding that has
   been developed. It's a rather thin binding and is not quite up-to-date, but like
   OpenGLAda, it also includes GLFW bindings.
 * [Globe3D](http://globe3d.sourceforge.net/): This is not only an OpenGL binding, but
   also provides methods for rendering of 3D objects. The included OpenGL binding is
   decent and up-to-date, but also rather thin.
 * [Lumen](http://www.niestu.com/software/lumen/): Lumen aims to be an interface
   library for Ada and is currently under development. It includes an autogenerated,
   very thin OpenGL binding.
