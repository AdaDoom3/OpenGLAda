## About

**OpenGLAda** is a thick Ada binding for [OpenGL](http://www.opengl.org/) and
[GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/). It enables you to create complex graphical
applications in Ada, using the OpenGL industry standard.

OpenGLAda is not the first attempt to create an OpenGL binding for Ada. Other bindings
are:

 * [AdaOpenGL](http://adaopengl.sourceforge.net/): Afaik the first binding that has
   been developed. It's a rather thin binding and is not quite up-to-date, but like
   OpenGLAda, it also includes GLFW bindings.
 * [Globe3D](http://globe3d.sourceforge.net/): This is not only an OpenGL binding, but
   also provides methods for rendering of 3D objects. The included OpenGL binding is
   decent and up-to-date, but also rather thin.
 * [Lumen](http://www.niestu.com/software/lumen/): Lumen aims to be an interface
   library for Ada and is currently under development. It includes an autogenerated,
   very thin OpenGL binding.

## Highlights

 * Dynamic run-time loading of OpenGL functions: OpenGLAda will link properly against
   OpenGL 1.1 because all functions that were introduced in OpenGL 1.2 or later are
   loaded at run-time. Functions will also automatically be loaded as ARB or EXT
   function if available.
 * Object-oriented design: All OpenGL objects are wrapped as tagged types. They are
   also reference-counted, so you do not need to worry about freeing memory yourself.
 * OS-agnostic: OpenGLAda builds on MacOSX, Windows and Linux without further
   configuration.
 * Structured: In contrast to the raw OpenGL library, OpenGLAda's functionality is
   structured into packages, so you have a better overview over the functionality
   of the API.
